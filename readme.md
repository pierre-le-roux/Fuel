# Fuel App

## Context
    Building an application to store car trips and calculate yearly running cost.
### Why?
    I'm really want to build a small frontend website that I can use to manage my fuel and maintenance of my cars. I know there are apps available, but most of them have subscriptions. I'm looking to expand my skills and also build something functional for myself.
### Wants?
    - Track my fuel milage
    - Add my geo location when I fill up
    - Store maintenance invoices and items used for quick reference
    - Dashboard showing a couple running metrics


## Vision
    The idea will be to use a static web app from Azure to house to frontend. The backend will be a file storage account with a csv file.

    



## TODO
- build safe database
